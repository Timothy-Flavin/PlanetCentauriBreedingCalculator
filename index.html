  <h1>Planet Centauri Breeding calculator V0.1.0</h1>
  <p>
    This is a calculator to find the best possible breeding pairs in Planet Centauri given a list of monsters <br/>
    The first monster is your target monster. This means that you put the stats you want in the '0' slot. <br/>
  </p>
  <button id="ShowInfoButton">Show/Hide Info</button>
  <p id="ShowInfoText"  style="display: none;">
  <b>Name:</b> The name of the monster you are breeding, ex: Whisp or Zombie<br/><br/>
  <b>Rarity:</b> Rarity is the color of the monster's name when hovered over. <br/>
  There are 7 levels or rarity, white, green, purple, blue, yellow, orange, <br/>
  and red. 1-7. A monster can only level in a given trait up to it's rarity.<br/>
  For instance, a green Scorpion with Life Bonus 7 will only ever get to Life<br/>
  Bonus 2 because it's rarity, green, is rarity 2. Even at level 70. <br/>
  The calculator will be looking for the chances of creating a monster<br/>
  with a rarity equal or greater than the rarity of the target monster<br/>
  so if monster 0 has rarity 7 then only red/legendary monsters will be<br/>
  searched for.<br/><br/>
  <b>Shiny:</b> 1 for true, 0 for false. A monster's shinyness determines<br/>
  whether or not the monster will have a prefix such as 'rare' or <br/>
  'legendary'. This will also give the monster the pallet swap.<br/><br/>
  <b>Hp:</b> The hp modifier on the monster, 1-50. if the monster '0', the <br/>
  target monster has an hp > 0, then the calculator will look for a monster<br/>
  with an hp modifier greater than or equal to the target monster<br/><br/>
  <b>Atk:</b> same as hp but attack<br/><br/>
  <b>Attributes:</b> A monster can have up to 7 attributes. how high a given<br/>
  monster can level in a given attribute is decided by the minimum of<br/>
  it's attribute level and it's rarity. (See rarity above) In this<br/>
  calculator you must make sure that you name attributes the same or<br/>
  the calculator may think that two monsters hace different attributes<br/>
  when they don't. This is because I want this calculator to continue<br/>
  working when new attributes are added, and not all monsters can have<br/>
  all attributes. for example Life Bonus 3 is not the same as lifebonus3<br/>
  Spelling matters and this calculator will think that 2 monsters with <br/>
  life bonus written those 2 ways actually have different attributes. <br/>
  if any of a target monster's attributes are left blank, The calculator<br/>
  will assume you do not care what goes in those attribute slots.

  <p>This is the number of trials for each breeding pair. In future versions<br/>
    this will be done by math instead of trials, but more trials means slower<br/>
    but more accurate results</p>
